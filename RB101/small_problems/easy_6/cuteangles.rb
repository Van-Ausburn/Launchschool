# Write a method that takes a floating point number 
# that represents an angle between 0 and 360 degrees 
# and returns a String that represents that angle 
# in degrees, minutes and seconds. 
# You should use a degree symbol (Â°) to represent degrees,
# a single quote (') to represent minutes
# and a double quote (") to represent seconds.
# A degree has 60 minutes, 
# while a minute has 60 seconds.

#a method that returns the sum of two integers
#Casual:
#gets input from user or variables from the method
#adds two numbers
#shows the sum

#Formal:
#START the program
#Define method
#Either provide and READ two variables or GET integer 1 and integer 2 from user
#Perform operation
#END program
#PRINT sum of integers

#a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together 
#Given an array of strings
#Takes array of strings
#A loop that reads each string in the array, and outputs each string 
#Then add all the strings together and set it as a new string
#PRINTs the new string 

#Given an array of strings
#START the program
#Run loop until array is emptied so WHILE the iterator is the length of the array
#READ array, take each element of the array
#output each string SET new string 
#add each string
#PRINT strings added together as a new string
#END

#a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element 
#Takes an array of integers
#Reads 'every other element' - so every third element (1,3,5, 7..)
#Returns a new array with every other element

#START the program
#Run a loop that goes through the array index [each?]
#SET index value to start at 1
#SET iterator = 2 [So that it skips over] || set index to odd with a condition?
#Loops through index and READ array value at index  
#SETS new array 
#PRINT integers at odd index values as a new array
#END
